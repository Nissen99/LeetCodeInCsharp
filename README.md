# LeetCodeInCsharp

I started doing LeetCode to lear C# syntax/ways of doing things comming from Java, and it is now my main way of doing LeetCode.

I dont put alot of time into LeetCode as i see it as more a "For fun" activity, and the "For fun" coding activity i do at the moment, is working on a project where i am building a slot machine from scratch in C# with Blazor (Comming to git soon)

Messy strucure in Git, way better once cloned (Atleast in Rider)

My Solution to LeetCode problems in C#, these Solutions is 9/10 the Solution I came up with, as we have not yet begun our "Data strucures and Algorithms" course some of these solutions are far from optimal, but learning them is fun nonetheless.
